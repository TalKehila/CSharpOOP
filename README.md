What is a C# OOP 
C# oop is Object - Oriented programming  and the Purpose of it is organizes code into resable code objects 
its will make you code easier to write and more readable moreover to control your code easliy.
in OOP we realting to 4 principles and those are :

1.Inheritance- we can create new classes and make them inheritance the fields(parameters) of base class (parents class) 
wihtout code reuse.👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

2.Polymorphism- The polymorphism principle allows to diffrent class use the same parameters and methods of the base class 
and to implement them differently.🎭
For example ability of 2 animals like dog and cat do the same thing like eat but in diffrent way or make a voice 

3.Encapsulation - Imagine your bank account, there are details that you prefer to not be accessible to others, only to you. Encapsulation helps make your code more private about the details you want to hide  parts of the code that shouldn't be shown. 🔒

4. Abstraction - you can maje a calss and it will be like general description without going into details just can be described as an simple animal
